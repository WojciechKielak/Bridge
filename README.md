# Bridge
A concurrent programming project.
On a two-way road, there is a narrow bridge over which cars can only go in one direction at a time. A concurrent program to synchronize the passage of cars coming from opposite directions so that there are no collisions and a car from each direction can eventually cross the bridge. The times of appearance and passage of cars across the bridge are generated from random distributions with parameters entered by the user.
